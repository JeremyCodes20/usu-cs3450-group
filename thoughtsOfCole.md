## Form factor focus

 - Mobile-first: parkers, attendants
 - Desktop-first: University, supervisor
 - Both: Sellers

## Native component

Consider using a Raspberry Pi, with camera attached, to read QR codes, validate, 
run the gate.

## A note on sellers:

Sellers should be able to give away parking spots if they want. This should not 
be used as a way to get around the fees though.
